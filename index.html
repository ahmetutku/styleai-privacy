StyleAI does not collect personal data such as names, emails, or contact information.

Our app uses images stored locally on your device to suggest outfit combinations. These images are not uploaded to our servers unless explicitly sent by you to generate AI-based recommendations.

We use the OpenAI API to help generate style suggestions. This means clothing descriptions or filenames may be processed by OpenAI, but we do not share your identity or other personal data with them.

StyleAI does not use any advertising or analytics SDKs. No third-party tracking is used.

By using StyleAI, you consent to the limited use of your closet data for outfit recommendations. You can delete all app data at any time by deleting the app.

If you have any questions, contact us at: styl3ai@gmail.com
